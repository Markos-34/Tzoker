This program take the cordinates that I take from the scan image and draw for the first 6 boxes ( from 1-45 numbers) 5 X's for each box and then draw for the other 6 boxes (from 1-20 numbers) 1 X's for each box. Is not done yet it has some problems with the printing part. 

Also i have another file that is just a small application so you can run that file to print.
